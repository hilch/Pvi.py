Just for internal use. Do not modify or delete this file!!

This file indicates that the default library structure for versioned libraries will be ignored and the libary is treated as Ar or Vc dependent library.
Only counts for AS 3.00.80.xx or higher versions.

Therefore if a library folder contains this file but no library declaration files the library isn't valid anymore.
