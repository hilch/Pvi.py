find the following examples on GitHub [github.com/hilch/Pvi.py](https://github.com/hilch/Pvi.py/tree/main/examples)

### [list_objects1.py](https://github.com/hilch/Pvi.py/tree/main/examples/list_objects1.py) (ANSL)

this example lists objects with 'global scope' (modules, task and global variables)
from 'coffee machine' cpu and returns status information about them

### [list_objects2.py](https://github.com/hilch/Pvi.py/tree/main/examples/list_objects2.py) (ANSL)

this example lists global and local variables and their content

### [list_objects3.py](https://github.com/hilch/Pvi.py/tree/main/examples/list_objects3.py) (ANSL)

this example lists all local variables of a specific task and their content

### [list_objects4.py](https://github.com/hilch/Pvi.py/tree/main/examples/list_objects4.py) (INA2000)

this example lists objects with 'global scope' (modules, task and global variables)
from 'coffee machine' cpu and returns status information about them

This is similar to list_objects1.py but since we use a control running < AR 4.x ANSL is not available here and we change to good old INA2000

### [list_objects5.py](https://github.com/hilch/Pvi.py/tree/main/examples/list_objects5.py) (INA2000)

this example lists global and local variables and their content

This is similar to list_objects2.py but since we use a control running < AR 4.x ANSL is not available here and we change to good old INA2000

### [list_objects6](https://github.com/hilch/Pvi.py/tree/main/examples/list_objects6.py).py (INA2000)

this example lists all local variables of a specific task and their content

This is similar to list_objects3.py but since we use a control running < AR 4.x ANSL is not available here and we change to good old INA2000
